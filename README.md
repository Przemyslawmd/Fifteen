# Fifteen Puzzle
Fifteen game puzzle implementation.

Application is being implemented using C++ with Qt libraries (at this moment Qt version 4.8).
IDE is QtCreator.

Application is being implemented in Linux environment, but because of using Qt framework 
I suppose there shouldn't be any problems with compiling it under Windows.  

There are a lot of options available: 
- four sizes of board (not only a board with four rows and four columns as usually)
- five sizes of square
- three colors (in case of numeric board). 

Board may be created from an indicated graphic file as well. 

Last feature is that a board may be saved into a file and restored later.

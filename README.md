# Fifteen Puzzle
Fifteen game puzzle implementation.

This is a GUI application and is being implemented using C++ with Qt libraries (at this moment Qt version 4.8), 
IDE is QtCreator.

An environment is Linux, but because of using Qt framework, 
I suppose there shouldn't be any problem with compiling it under Windows.  

Game has a few options available: 
- four dimensions of board (not only a board with four rows and four columns as usually)
- five sizes of square
- three colors of square (in case of numeric board) 

Moreover, a board may be created from an indicated graphic file as well, so there are two main kinds of board: numeric and graphic. 

Last feature is that a board may be saved into a file and restored later.
